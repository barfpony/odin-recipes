    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix Marinade:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine your water, lemon juice, soy sauce, sesame oil, cardamom, thyme, and minced garlic. Then mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Marinade to Steaks:</strong> Pour your marinade into a large plastic bag and then place your tuna steaks in the bag with the marinade. Push out as much air as you can and thoroughly coat the steaks in the marinade.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate for 20 Mins:</strong> Allow the tuna steaks to marinate for 20 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook in Skillet:</strong> Heat a skillet over medium high heat, once the steaks are marinated and ready, then remove them from the bag and then place them on the heated skillet, cook each side for about 2 minutes. Brush the steaks with more of the marinade as they cook to add more flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Once you have cooked both sides of each steak remove them from the skillet, the internal temperature should reach 125 degrees fahrenheit. Allow them to rest for 2 minutes, they will continue to cook while they rest.</li>
        <li><strong>Eat:</strong> Enjoy fresh!</li>
